Below are some of the <b>Game of Active Directory (GOAD)</b> attack <b>write ups</b> I found useful in exploring my <b>GOAD Lab</b> instance. My GOAD Install writeup can be found [here](https://github.com/jjkirn/GOAD). 

The first 2 are just for <b>GOAD-Light</b> while the last 2 are for the full <b>GOAD</b> install.

1. <b>HacktheClown</b> (@hacktheclown) has a series of <b>10 youtube.com videos </b>that show you how to perform AD attacks on a <b>GOAD-Light</b> instance:

- [AD Attacks using GOAD-Light](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL08nYpWQJ_zM4JxekcckBVjglpVWgg2u0)

2.	<b>Cyb3rByte</b> has a 3 part series on [Medium](https://cyb3rbyte.medium.com/) covering <b>GOAD-Light</b>:

3.	<b>Moe</b> (@FAMASoon) has 4 good write-ups for attacking a full <b>GOAD</b> instance, but they are in Japanese. You will need google translate to view them in English.

- [GOAD - part 12 - Trusts](https://mayfly277.github.io/posts/GOADv2-pwning-part12/ )


Some of these attacks are out-of-date and need to be updated. An example is <b>cme </b> is outdated and we should use <b>nxc</b>. Also, <b>nxc</b> has options that <b>cme</b> doesn't. Check out Cyb3rByte 3 part series and you will get an idea of what I and referring to.

That being said, these 12 attacks were updated in 2024 and are still very useful.

## Now Ready for attacks using Kali ?
